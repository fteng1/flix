Please list two areas of the assignment you'd like to **discuss further with your peers** during the next class (examples include better ways to implement something, how to extend your app in certain ways, etc):

1. Change the CollectionView tab of the app to filter based on genre, instead of only displaying the same movies as the Now Playing tab. 
2. Add a list of locations in which each movie can be watched, such as nearby theaters.

## Notes

Describe any challenges encountered while building the app.
- UIActivityIndicatorView was not displaying when fetching movie data because it was placed below the movie cells in the table, which did not show up on screen. 
- UIActivityIndicatorView took up space in the view instead of popping up, which was resolved by moving it outside of the TableView.
